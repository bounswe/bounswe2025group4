# Since this is a Vite application, all environment variables must be prefixed with VITE_ to be accessible in the frontend code
# This is just an example file - when you copy it to .env.local, you'll need to replace the placeholder values with your actual configuration
# The actual values in .env.example should be example/dummy values since this file will be committed to the repository
# The .env.local file should be in your .gitignore to keep sensitive information secure

# API Configuration
VITE_API_BASE_URL=/api
VITE_SOCKET_URL=ws://localhost:8000
